# 1. Raiderâ€“Parker Problem
This problem studies the behavior of one-dimensional, inviscid compressible flows. Its setup often resembles Sod's Shock Tube Problem, where a sudden discontinuity in density and pressure propagates through the domain, generating waves (shocks, rarefactions, or contact discontinuities). Mathematically, using the Euler equations for compressible flow:
- Mass Conservation (Continuity Equation):
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x}=0$$
- Momentum Conservation:
$$\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u^2+p)}{\partial x}=0$$
- Energy Conservation:
$$\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} +\frac{\partial [(E+p)u]}{\partial x}=0$$

with $\rho$ is density, $u$ is velocity, $p$ is pressure, $E=\rho e+\frac{1}{2}\rho u^2$ is total energy per unit volumn, $e=\frac{p}{(\gamma-1)\rho}$ is internal energy per unit mass, $\gamma$ is ratio of specific heat.

# 2. Lax-Wendroff Scheme
Lax-Wendroff scheme is a second-order numerical method solving hyperbolic PDEs, combining Taylor expansion with FDM. For conserved variable $U(x,t)$, this scheme uses a second-order Taylor expansion in time:
$$U_i^{n+1}=U_i^n + \Delta t \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2}$$
